My name is Robiana Labady and I am in Software Development 1, CRN 33022.

The project I uploaded was a homework assignment from the first few weeks of my Advance Java Programming class. It utilized a generic (E) in a function that would find and 
return the minimum element in the array. In the assignment, I was given three different groups of values for the arrays: colors, numbers, and circle radius. It was expected that 
whatever values I put, the output would show the minimum value in each array in an organized matter.
